In this project, I was interested in the experience of individuals who are unable to form mental images, a condition known as aphantasia.
If I were to ask you to imagine an apple in your mind, the chances are that you visualise an image of an apple in your mind's eye.
Individuals with aphantasia, on the other hand, would not report seeing an image of the apple. Instead they often report they think about the concept of an apple, the properties and semantics of what an apple is like.

More specifically, I was curious about how individuals with aphantasia process incomplete or obstructed visual information. This is like when parts of an object are hidden behind something in the foreground, like when a car is visible through a picket fence). 
For individuals who can visualize, we fill in the obstructed parts of the car in our mind's eye and are able to recognize that a car is parked behind the fence.
But given that those with aphantasia do not experience vivid mental imagery, how are they able perceive and recognize the car?
