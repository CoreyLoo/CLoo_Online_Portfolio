This research project was completed as part of my PhD thesis work.
The above link is to a markdown file describing the analysis.
Here is the [script used to create that markdown file](Aphantasia_research_project/aphantasia_research_project.Rmd) 

Skills demonstrated:

- Data analysis

# Independent Projects in Python

## [Project 1: Supermarket Loyalty - Predicting Customer Spending](Supermarket_Loyalty/CLoo_Practical_Exam_Supermarket_Loyalty.ipynb)

This project was completed as part of a practical exam for the Associate Data Scientist Certificate from Datacamp.

In this project, I analyzed the spending habits of customers of International Essentials, an international supermarket chain.
By analyzing customer traits such as previous spending habits and years enrolled in the loyalty program, I trained and tuned a linear regression model to predict the amount each customer would spend during the next year.

Skills demonstrated:
- Data cleaning and wraggling
- Model implementation (model fitting and cross-validation)
- Model tuning (feature selection and hyper parameter tuning)

## [Project 1: Impact Analysis of GoodThought NGO Initiatives](https://www.datacamp.com/datalab/w/11aec87b-e9df-407d-8252-7821bad02243/edit)

In this project I analyzed the charity assignments of GoodThought NGO where I:
- Listed the top five assignments by total donation value, categorized by donor type.
- Identified the highest impact score assignment per region, with at least one donation.
